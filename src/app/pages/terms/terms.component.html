Your Automatic top-up will add additional funds to your TopBeta Account. Money added to your TopBeta account using this recurring payment process is subject to these specific terms and conditions, together with the payment terms and conditions and Top Beta’s standard service terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions you must not submit a request through this recurring payment process.

    <div class="break">
        You may cancel any auto top-up you have set up on your Account at any time and the cancellation will be effective before the next auto top-up payment is due to be paid.
